# .bureau/regression/run.sh — run this repo's committed Bureau regression suite.
# Convention: docs/conventions.md § Regression fixture file format
# Promotion: scripts/promote-fixtures.sh reuses this runner for its post-copy green check.
#
# Resolves the repo root, exports $ROOT, and runs every NN-*.md fixture's
# `command:` field. A fixture PASSES when its command exits 0 (each fixture is
# authored so its guarantee holding == exit 0, and mutation-tested to exit
# non-zero when the guarantee is deleted). `retired:`/`slow:` fixtures are skipped.
#
# Usage:  sh .bureau/regression/run.sh
# Exit:   0 = all passed (or skipped), 1 = one or more failed, 2 = setup error.
